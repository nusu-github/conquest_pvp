# Lantern Load

Lantern Load provides a simple implementation of version resolution intended to
allow data packs and their dependencies to load in a controllable order. It is
currently used by the [AESTD] project, and in the future will be used by the
[Phi] project. This library is dedicated to the public domain and contains no
branding, so it is a simple addition to any data pack that requires dependencies
and wishes to be compatible with the greater data pack ecosystem.
